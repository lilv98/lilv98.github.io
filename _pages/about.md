I'm a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Toronto, where I work with Prof. [Ashton Anderson](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~ashton/) on human behavior modeling using AI/ML. My research focuses on understanding and modeling human decision-making, particularly in strategic domains such as chess, where I explore the fascinating intersection of AI and human cognition and behavior.

You'll likely find me staying active through sports and outdoor activities. I'm passionate about basketball, badminton, billiards, and cycling – each offering its own unique blend of strategy, skill, and physical challenge that often inspires and motivates my academic work.
